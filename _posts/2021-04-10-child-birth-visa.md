नमस्ते 🙏🏻, 

I Hope, this will be helpful.  
Visa for parents in the case of child birth category.

* Send Email or Call respective Indian Consulate office regarding enquiry about visa.

* They will ask you to send some documents (soft copy) to verify the eligibility. They will forward initial approval to VFS. 

* You will receive a call from VFS to confirm appointment for documents submission.

* VFS offers you fast-track process which costs rupees 40k for 2 people. They will come to your doorstep to collect documents and fingerprints. Visa processing time is ~1 week. 

* List of invitee person’s documents: Mutterpass, Resident Permit, Invitation letter, formal obligation letter (not mandatory), Passport copies of parents to check the relationship.

Note: Soft copies of all documents are valid (during this pandemic situation). You can submit bank statement of your parents instead of formal obligation letter( but please do inform this to consulate in-advance in 1st communication)

Please feel free to ping me🙏
